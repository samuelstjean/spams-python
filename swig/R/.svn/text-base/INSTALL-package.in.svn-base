This directory contains files to build the R interfaces
to the functions of SPAMS library already interfaced with matlab.

WARNING : the API of spams.OMP and spams.OMPMask has changed since version V2.2

##################################################

tar zxf spams-R-%FULLVERSION%.tar.gz
cd spams-R
# rlib=install-directory
export R_LIBS=$rlib
R CMD INSTALL --html -l $R_LIBS spams

This should work on linux and MacOS. For windows see below.
However, if you have undefined symbols, you can add extra libraries
by modifying, in spams/src/Makevars the line
EXTRA_LIBS=

# tests
Note : to run test_TrainDL and test_TrainDL_Memory you need the R package png
     (a version of this package can be found in the current directory).

We suppose that environment variable R_LIBS is set:
cd $R_LIB/spams/test
Rscript test_spams.R -help
Rscript test_spams.R

Warning : for now the R interface is missing a little subset of the functions
	described in the documentation of SPAMS.

# Notes:
As the C++ interface is built by Swig, I must add
dummy documentations for 3 class S4 methods
(I could not avoid warnings in R CMD check).
If you have a version of R lower than 2.13, there will remain
one warning with R CMD check, because SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS must be manually defined.

Installing on macOS:
====================
	I have tested it on macosx-10 64bits, kernel 10.8.0 :
	I have installed R with popt, and added /opt/local/bin to my PATH
	and "R CMD INSTALL" worked fine,
	but I had to redefine TMPDIR (export TMPDIR=/var/tmp)

Installing on windows :
======================

On a 32bits windowssystem:
-------------------------

you need MinGW (www.mingw.org)
and GnuWin32 zip (http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/zip.htm)

To build a binary package :
- open a MinGW console and extract files from the tar source package (tar zxf ....)
  - enter directory spams-R
  - execute win-build.sh
  You will obtain spams-R-%FULLVERSION%.win32.exe (and spams_%VERSION%.zip)
  The .exe contains the .zip will automatically the module in R.

On a 64bits windows system :
---------------------------
you will build a package for 32 and 64 bits systems.

You need to install 
MinGW (www.mingw.org) 
and mingw64 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files)
and GnuWin32 zip (http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/zip.htm)
and GnuWin32 unzip (http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/unzip.htm)

- open a MinGW console as admin
  (right click on the icon and select "Execute as admin")
- extract files from tar file
- cd spams-R
  ./win-build.sh

You will obtain spams-R-%FULLVERSION%.win32+amd64.exe (and spams_%VERSION%.zip)
  which contains 32 and 64 bits versions
  Note : the .exe file will only install the R module corresponding
  to the architecture of the system.

To manually install the binary package:
=======================================
 - in R gui, select "install package from file" in menu "Packages"
 - or start R and type
   install.packages('spams-installation-path/spams_%VERSION%.zip',repos=NULL)

NB: on windows7, you must execute R as admin.
